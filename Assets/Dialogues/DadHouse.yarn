        Dad: Ah, my daughter, there you are!
        Iman: Using the daughter card, I see.
        Dad: Yes. My computer is broken, can you take a look at it?
        Iman: It worked fine yesterday. What did you do?

        Dad: Ah, my daughter, you're back!
        Iman: Using the daughter card, I see.
        Dad: Yes. Will you check my computer now?
        Iman: You said it was broken, right? It worked fine yesterday. What did you do?
    <<endif>>
    Dad: Nothing! I turned it on and there's images that keep appearing!
    Iman: Hm, you mean spam? Maybe it caught a virus.
    Dad: So my computer is sick? Can you take a look?
    Iman: It's not really my area…
    Dad: My daughter has a diploma in computer science and can't even help her own dad?
    Iman: Okay, fine! I'll take a look.
        // add command(s) that start(s) computer cutscene
    Iman: Hm, I see.
    Dad: What?
    Iman: So if I do this, and I download that, and I delete some stuff…
    Dad: What are you doing?
    Iman: …
    Dad: …
    Iman: Let me try something else.
    Dad: …
    Iman: There we go!
    Dad: Did you do it?
    Iman: Yes. I just reset to factory settings.
    Dad: ...
    Iman: ...
    Dad: Oooh!
    Iman: See!
    Dad: Ah, I have such a smart daughter! I knew it. I said to myself: “She can do it!”
    Iman: Don't mention it.
    Dad: I know you will do great things. Reach for the stars, my daughter!
    Iman: Alright, alright. I think that's enough for today.
    Dad: Ah, your friend Nour was searching for you earlier.
    Iman: Really? What did she want?
    Dad: You'll have to ask her! She said you could meet her at the edge of town.
    Iman: I wonder what this is about…
    Dad: I guess we'll find out...
    // command dad looks at camera
    Iman: ???
    Dad: In the next DLC!
    Dad: Thank you for playing, we hope you enjoyed your experience and will leave us a nice review!
    Iman: What?
    Dad: Like and subscribe in the link at the end of the credits!
    // command iman looks at camera
    Dad: And never forget to reach for your dreams!
